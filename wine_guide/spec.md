# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - CLI interacts with the user and allows the user to navigate a list of the 100 top wines.
- [x] Pull data from an external source - Pulls data from James Suckling's top 100 wines list on www.jamessuckling.com
- [x] Implement both list and detail views - In order to navigate such a long list, I broke it down into segments of 10. Pressing "2" will display the top 10 wines on the list, pressing "2" will display 11-20, etc. From here, the user can select a particular wine by entering that wine's rank. This screen includes the wine's rank, name, vintage, description, rating, region and country.
